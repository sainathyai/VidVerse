# Project Rules

## Documentation Policy
- **NEVER create .md files unless explicitly requested by the user**
- Always summarize information in chat responses instead of creating markdown documentation
- Only create .md files when the user specifically asks: "create an md file" or similar explicit request
- This includes: README files, documentation, guides, summaries, PRDs, task lists, etc.
- Exception: Code comments and inline documentation are allowed

## General Guidelines
- Focus on implementing features, not documenting them
- Provide concise summaries in chat
- Ask before creating any new files
